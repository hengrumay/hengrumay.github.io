### What I did as a neuroimaging scientist...

As a neuroimaging scientist (neuroscientist) [I studied brain signals in both health and disorder](https://github.com/hengrumay/brain_dances). 

The technique I specialized in is called [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](http://megcommunity.org/what-is-meg), 
which picks up the magnetic field of the electrical brain signals at milliseconds time frequency. 

When these elecromagnetic brain signals are combined with brain anatomical images obtained through 
[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) 
one can really go further in their investigations as well as computational analyses to ask and estimate solutions to questions 
like: 
  - Where is the source of the measured brain signals? 
  - How do different parts of the brain communicate with with other?
  - How do brain signals modulate with perception and action (cognitive) processes? 
  - Can we use brain signals to predict future behaviour? 
  - etc. 

These are the kinds of investigations I and other scientist colleagues in the world worked on
and some of the my collaborative research are published in the following scientific articles:

#### Methodology | Reliability: 
- [MEG sensor and source measures of visually induced gamma-band oscillations are highly reliable](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.05.006)
