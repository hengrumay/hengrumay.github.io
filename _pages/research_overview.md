#### As a neuroimaging scientist (neuroscientist)...
[I studied brain signals in both health and disorder](https://github.com/hengrumay/brain_dances).   
The technique I specialized in is called [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](http://megcommunity.org/what-is-meg), 
which picks up the magnetic field of the electrical brain signals at milliseconds time frequency.   
When these elecromagnetic brain signals are combined with brain anatomical images obtained through 
[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) 
one can really go further in their investigations as well as computational analyses to study and estimate solutions to questions 
like: 
<li> Where is the source of the measured brain signals? </li>
<li> How do different parts of the brain communicate with with other?</li>
<li> How do brain signals modulate with perception and action (cognitive) processes?</li> 
<li> Can we use brain signals to predict future behaviour?</li> 
<li> How does brain activity change as we age, or when we become mentally ill? </li>
<li> etc. </li>

These are the kinds of investigations I and other scientist colleagues in the world worked on
and some of the my collaborative research are published in the following scientific articles:
