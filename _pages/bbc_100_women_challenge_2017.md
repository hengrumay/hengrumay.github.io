#### BBC 100 Women's Challenge

I have always been interested in using technology/data/science in meaningful ways and contributing to social good =) 

Most recently I contributed remotely from Denver, CO, to the the group lead by Rumman and Natalia who were team-leads in the [BBC 100 Women's Challenge. We built a speech recognition app, "all-ai", to help track meeting dynamics and encourage speaking up](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-100-women-challenge-2017-silicon-valley-reveal-solution).   

We used a combination of speech recognition and natural language processing as well as data structuring and web application development to create this proof-of-concept app within ~3 intense days. The fun and comaraderie made it totally worth it!
