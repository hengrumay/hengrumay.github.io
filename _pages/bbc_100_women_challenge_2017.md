#### BBC 100 Women Challenge

I have always been interested in using technology, data, and science in meaningful ways as well as contributing to social good =) 

Most recently I contributed remotely from Denver, CO, to the [BBC 100 Women Challenge. I was with team "Sparkles & Snaps", led by artificial intelligence specialist Rumman Chowdury and software engineer Natalia Margolis. We built a speech recognition app, "all-ai", to help track meeting dynamics and encourage speaking up](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-100-women-challenge-2017-silicon-valley-reveal-solution).   

We used a combination of speech recognition and natural language processing, together with requisite data extraction, transformation, and web application development to create this proof-of-concept *gender-neutral* app within ~3 intense days. The fun and camaraderie made the experience truly memorable!
